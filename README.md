# NetApp2.0 - an application for business networking

# What is business networking?

Business networking is the process of establishing a beneficial relationship with other business people and potential clients or  customers. 

Networking events or local business luncheons present you with  opportunities to find others who are in similar circumstances as you work to grow your business. These events are generally put together for the purpose of introducing new concepts and methods being used while  providing a platform for local business people to meet and exchange  ideas.

# How does the phydgital networking works?
Phygital networking (physics + digital)combines both world: offline communication and online performance.

Networking comes down to the following steps:
1. The presenter gathers people in the hall
2. People create their own accounts in the app. Also they create project-card which describes a project or an idea.
3. The presenter creates a networking-event and share with participants connection-code.
4. Participants hit the “connect” button and fill in the provided code
5. Then participants choose one project to participate and wait the beginning.
6. The presenter activates the event. The app will shuffle participants and shows the instructions on the screen. Now participants only have to follow the onscreen tips.

# Four main stages of networking
**Stage 1. The transition into subgroups.** All participants are divided into mini groups for closer interaction. Communication takes place in person. At this stage, the participant sees the number of their group on the phone screen and the time it takes to find the group in the hall and join it.  
**Stage 2. Introduction of participants.** During the allotted time, participants should introduce themselves and briefly talk about their projects and / or their activities.  
**Stage 3. Networking.** At this stage, participants form links between project cards. To form a link, the participant must create a "resource request". And the recipient of the request must confirm it. Based on these queries, the system visualizes all relationships between projects.  
**Stage 4. The results of networking.** Participants receive personalized and General statistics on the event (the number of requests sent / accepted, the rating of participants by the number of formed links between projects, and so on).  

Stages 1-3 can be repeated several times depending on the initial settings made by the presenter.

# Installation
1. Download the repo archive
2. Create your own database and fix connectionString in web.config file.
3. Run the migrations
4. Now you have a test environment

### The development of the project is stopped. Feel free to modify it and build cool networking-app based on this idea.
